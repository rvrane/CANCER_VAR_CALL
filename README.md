**Cancer Variant Calling Pipeline**

This pipeline is designed for the analysis of tumor samples to identify somatic and germline mutations using next-generation sequencing data. It includes the following steps:

1. **Quality Control**: Perform quality control on raw sequencing data using FastQC.
2. **Trimming**: Trim adapter sequences and low-quality reads using Trimmomatic.
3. **Alignment**: Map trimmed reads to a reference genome using BWA.
4. **Sorting and Indexing**: Convert aligned reads to BAM format, sort, and index using Samtools.
5. **Mark Duplicates**: Identify and mark duplicate reads using Picard Tools.
6. **Base Recalibration**: Correct systematic errors in base quality scores using GATK.
7. **Variant Calling**: Call variants using HaplotypeCaller from GATK.
8. **Variant Filtering**: Filter variants for somatic and germline mutations using Mutect2 from GATK.
9. **Annotation**: Annotate variants with functional and clinical information using SnpEff and ANNOVAR.
10. **Prediction of Variant Effects**: Predict the functional impact of variants using REVEL.

This pipeline integrates various bioinformatics tools and databases to comprehensively analyze tumor samples and identify potentially pathogenic mutations associated with cancer.
